Create this assignment using react js

Task to create a service layer for API requests in our React.js project. The task involves setting up axios with interceptors and implementing methods to handle GET, POST, and PUT requests. Additionally, you will need to handle different status codes and organize the code with URL constants and a base URL.

Here are the key requirements:

Setup Axios: Create an axios instance with a base URL and configure interceptors for requests and responses.
Interceptors: Implement request and response interceptors to manage headers and error handling.
API Service: Develop a service layer with methods for GET, POST, and PUT requests.
URL Constants: Define and use URL constants for API endpoints.
Status Codes: Handle various HTTP status codes in the response interceptor.
I have provided a sample code structure to guide you. Please refer to the attached example for implementation details.
Create a public github repo and share us the url.
